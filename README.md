# Problem Statements:

## Lack of Sales Insights Across India
Madhav Store currently lacks a centralized system to track and analyze its online sales performance across different states in India, making it difficult to identify high-revenue regions and optimize marketing strategies.

## Need for Category-Wise Demand Analysis
Without a detailed breakdown of sales quantity by product category, the store struggles to understand customer preferences, leading to inefficient inventory management and missed sales opportunities.

The store lacks visibility into monthly profit trends, making it challenging to forecast earnings, adjust pricing strategies, and maximize revenue.

## Understanding Customer Spending Patterns
There is no system to track customer-wise sales data, preventing Madhav Store from identifying high-value customers and personalizing marketing efforts to drive repeat purchases.

## Payment Mode Analysis for Better Transactions
Without insights into the preferred payment methods, the store cannot optimize checkout options or address payment-related customer drop-offs.

## Sub-Category Profitability Challenges
There is no clear understanding of which product sub-categories generate the highest or lowest profits, making it difficult to prioritize high-margin products and improve overall profitability.
